Future Engineers: Mondays from 12pm-1pm
In this series, students will have the opportunity to create projects both guided and 				independently. Students will learn to use many building materials to make structures from 			minuscule to taller than they are! Each week will explore different materials and types of projects. Innovation and 	student suggestions are encouraged! Have your kiddo start thinking of all of the things they’d like to build! 

Music from around the world: Tuesdays 12pm-1pm	
In this series, students will have the opportunity to learn from our wonderful instructor, Collette 			Anderson, who has her Master’s degree in Music and is the music teacher for a local 				Elementary School.

The last day of the series will be a talent Recital with prepared 			pieces to wow the audience with! 

Math/Technology: Wednesdays 12pm-1pm
In this series, students will be introduced to a vast array of technology. They will be able to explore the world through Oculus VR programs, bring their real-life play doh creations into the digital world and make them characters in their very own game, play active-pre coding games with and without screens, and much more! We will also explore the fun side of math in group and individual hands on activities. 

Art brought to Mighty Kids by Rainy Day art Studio!: Thursdays from 12pm-1pm
Students will be immersed in a variety of mediums, materials and colors. We will explore color theory, a variety of textures, explore different genres, learn about various artists and explore other cultures. Students will bring home a culmination piece on the last day of class! Art is vital for a future in any field, especially STEM fields, as major tech companies are expressing the need for more creative, artistic professionals to design the technologies of the future. 

Silly Science: Fridays from 12pm-1pm
This is a safe and interactive class full of awesome science experiments. Students will get to 			boil water at room temperature, light up lightbulbs using only the energy from their body, make 			water walk, make a rock float, and no science class would be complete without the rupturing 			volcano experiment! All these and many more in our Winter session!
