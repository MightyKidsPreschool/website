Each day from 12-1pm children are invited to explore STEM through play with our unique STEM-based engineering toys,  interactive technology, age appropriate robotics and more. This hour can be added to any enrolled students school day for more STEM interaction. No set curriculum is implemented during this time, this is your child's time to create, design and build whatever their imagination allows using our many materials. 

Non-enrolled children may also come for this hour of STEM engagement as a stand alone drop-in class any day!
