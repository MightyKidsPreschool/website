This class is offered M-F during the school year from 9am-12pm. It is meant for children who have already completed at least one year of preschool at any school. This class gives students even more class time to prepare for Kindergarten in all of the traditional subjects as well as that added boost in STEM concepts. We pride ourselves on having a well-rounded approach to STEM learning. We use a variety of tools, games and toys both requiring screen and screen free (in some cases a combination of the two) and both individually and in group activities. Your child will be prepared for Kindergarten both academically and socially and for a future built around Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Don’t worry, we don’t forget how important art and play are.
