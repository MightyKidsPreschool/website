"This class is offered M-F during the school year from 9am-12pm. It is meant for children who have already completed at least one year of preschool at any school. This class gives students even more class time to prepare for Kindergarten in all of the traditional subjects as well as that added boost in STEM concepts. We pride ourselves on having a well-rounded approach to STEM learning. We use a variety of tools, games and toys both requiring screen and screen free (in some cases a combination of the two) and both individually and in group activities. Your child will be prepared for Kindergarten both academically and socially and for a future built around Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Don’t worry, we don’t forget how important art and play are. Mighty Kids is excited to announce a new offering in our Pre-K program. We are following in the footsteps of many wonderful programs all over the country in offering Lunch Bunch. 

Student who will be entering Kindergarten the year following, will spend the part of their class time eating lunch with their peers. Full day Kindergarten is a long day with many new things and one of the most chaotic and confusing things about it for new Kindy’s is lunch time. They are used to eating lunch at home with a parent or caregiver and maybe a baby sibling. In our program, they will bring a lunch (or have the option to buy one, to be billed with tuition) and will practice retrieving their lunch from a bin in an organized manner, bringing their food to the lunch table, eating with their peers without making a mess or being excessively rambunctious, cleaning their own space and asking to be excused by staff to wait in line for the next activity. It is invaluable experience for them to get their bearings in a large group cafeteria-type setting so that they can enter the Elementary School Cafeteria with confidence!"
