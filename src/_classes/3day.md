"This class is offered on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9am-12pm for preschool and 9-1 for Pre-K during the school year. It is designed for students who are either 3 or 4 years old by September 1st of the year they will enter the class. In this class we will focus on Kindergarten readiness in the areas of beginning reading, math, social studies, science, history, art and classroom/social skills. Our teachers are experienced in preparing children for success in Kindergarten and beyond. STEM will be incorporated daily using both screen and non-screen activities, experiments, group games and toys designed with STEM in mind. Play is also an important aspect of a childâ€™s education and social growth and will not be ignored."
