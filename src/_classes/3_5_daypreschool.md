This class is offered M-F from 9am-12pm during the school year. This class is for children who are 3 years old by September 1st of the year they are entering class. In this class we focus on solidifying letters, numbers, counting to 20 (or beyond when ready), colors, sorting, matching, shapes and art. This is also when we introduce students to the concepts of sitting still for group lessons, working as a team with other students, sharing toys, standing in line, and social skills. STEM concepts will be introduced in this class as well using games, science experiments and group activities that focus on introducing these four important fields of study.
