This class is offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9am-12pm during the school year. This class is for children who are 3 years old and are entering school for the first time. In this class we focus on solidifying letters, numbers, counting to 20 (or beyond when ready), colors, sorting, matching, shapes and art. This is also when we introduce students to the concepts of sitting still for group lessons, working as a team with other students, sharing toys, standing in line, and social skills. STEM concepts will be introduced in this class as well using games, software experiments and group activities that focus on introducing these four important fields of study.Student who will be entering Kindergarten the year following, will spend the part of their class time eating lunch with their peers. Full day Kindergarten is a long day with many new things and one of the most chaotic and confusing things about it for new Kindyâ€™s is lunch time. They are used to eating lunch at home with a parent or caregiver and maybe a baby sibling. In our program, they will bring a lunch (or have the option to buy one, to be billed with tuition) and will practice retrieving their lunch from a bin in an organized manner, bringing their food to the lunch table, eating with their peers without making a mess or being excessively rambunctious, cleaning their own space and asking to be excused by staff to wait in line for the next activity. It is invaluable experience for them to get their bearings in a large group cafeteria-type setting so that they can enter the Elementary School Cafeteria with confidence!
