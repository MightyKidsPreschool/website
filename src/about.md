section1:
    title: Welcome to Mighty Kids Preschool
    description: We are a Preschool/Pre-K in Bothell, WA (located inside of the new Mighty Coders facility) offering traditional Kindergarten readiness academics, play based learning and a leg up in STEM education. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. STEM learning in children breeds curiousity, prepares kids for today's technology in Elementary school and fosters creativity, but they'll just know they're having fun!

    title: Kindergarten readiness
    description: Our staff has many years of experience in traditional preschool classrooms as well as formal training in Early Childhood Education. Your child will be beginning to commit letters, numbers, sounds, shapes and colors to memory. Once they are ready, we also look forward to helping your child begin to open up their imagination to the world of reading! Subjects such as art, social studies, history, music and of course play (a child’s first form of education and peer relationship building) will be integrated regularly. Your child will go to Kindergarten already knowing what is expected of them in a classroom setting structurally, educationally and socially. Mighty Kids is excited to announce a new offering in our Pre-K program. We are following in the footsteps of many wonderful programs all over the country in offering Lunch Bunch. 
Student who will be entering Kindergarten the year following, will spend the part of their class time eating lunch with their peers. Full day Kindergarten is a long day with many new things and one of the most chaotic and confusing things about it for new Kindy’s is lunch time. They are used to eating lunch at home with a parent or caregiver and maybe a baby sibling. In our program, they will bring a lunch (or have the option to buy one, to be billed with tuition) and will practice retrieving their lunch from a bin in an organized manner, bringing their food to the lunch table, eating with their peers without making a mess or being excessively rambunctious, cleaning their own space and asking to be excused by staff to wait in line for the next activity. It is invaluable experience for them to get their bearings in a large group cafeteria-type setting so that they can enter the Elementary School Cafeteria with confidence!

    title: STEM learning
    description: Mighty Kids is fortunate enough to be located inside of the Mighty Coders franchise facility off of Bothell Everett Highway in Bothell, WA. We have full access to an entire library of laptops, tablets, kids’ STEM software and hands-on STEM activities. Our staff also has experience in bringing these fields of study off the screen and into the classroom with science experiments, engineering projects and hands-on mathematic manipulatives and tools. Play time will also include toys and games that can help build pathways needed in a child’s brain to help them learn STEM concepts more easily later in life,but they will just know they’re having fun!
