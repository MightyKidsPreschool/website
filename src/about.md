    title: Welcome to Mighty Kids STEM Learning Center
    description: "**Registration for the 2020-2021 school year begins February 1st. The $100 registration fee is due at registration with the first month's tuition due July 1st 2020. Tours will be held Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 10am and Wednesdays at 5:30pm, no appoinment necessary. 
    <br>
We are a half-day Preschool and Elementary-aged before & after school program in Bothell, WA offering traditional Kindergarten readiness academics, play based learning and a leg up in STEM education. STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. STEM learning in children breeds curiousity & prepares kids for today's technology and fosters creativity, but they'll just know they're having fun! We utilize hands-on activities, experiments and team building exercises. Our proprietary STEM curriculum is 90% screen free. Our holiday and weather closure schedule follows the Everett School District Calendar.
<br>
We provide a fun, nurturing environment for our students with low staff to student ratios (max 1:7) and positive discipline practices. We have seen great strides made by students as they navigate their very first experience in a group of their peers to being confident and comfortable excelling in new situations."
sections:
  - title: Safety and security
    description: "Our students' safety is our number one concern. We have a secure facility with automatic electronic door locks inside and out, keeping kids in and strangers out at all times.
We utilize cameras that monitor the classroom 24/7 and can be reviewed for the safety of the students.
Staff are all background checked and first aid/CPR certified."
  - title: Pre-literacy and writing
    description: "We expose kinds to the fine motor skills needed to start writing letters using tweezers, scissors, sensory bins and more.
We use the well known and respected literacy curriculum Handwriting Without Tears to begin the process of turning fine motor skills into learning to write letters and numbers.
We expose children to name recognition throughout the day using student mantained files, job charts, assigned cubbies etc.
We use ZooPhonics to expose kids to letter sounds in multiple ways for different learning styles (by sight, sound and movement).
Our teachers look for teachable moments during play and group times to talk about letters and point out literature in their environment."

      - subtitle: "Science:"
        description: "Regular fun with science experiments gives them experience with the scientific method, teamwork and critical thinking.
All class themes are scientific in nature, exploring themes such as space, nature, food, emotions, anatomy and more.
Kids have access to our science station with fossils, real shark teeth, fascinating gems and stones, resin encased insects and arachnids for exploration with magnifying glasses, tweezers etc.
We include hands on activities that explore our world including our 8 ft tall wind tube/scarf cannon that lets kids explore air pressure, air diversion and gravity over and over again while getting exercise and having fun.
Our science activites utilize chemistry sets, circuit boards, electricity, and much more.
Light boards with colorful and clear manipulatives for exploring light theory, color mixing and shapesm are a favorite among our students."
      - subtitle: "Technology:"
        description: "While most of our program is screen free, we utilize technology in our learning in limited amounts.
We utilize Oculus VR headsets occasionally for videos that relate to our themes.
We use apps for coding and video game building occasionally as well as logic building games.
We use apps for programing and controlling real robots.
We use Playdoh touch augmented reality app to let kids build real play doh creations and then make them come to life in their very own game with characters they built with real play doh.
We use smart balls with accelerometers and gyroscopes connected to an app that gives kids the opportunity to be exposed to distance, force and counting measurements."
      - subtitle: "Engineering:"
        description: 'We regularly engage the kids in engineering projects during group times and many of our toys are engineering minded; such as straws and connectors, tinker trays, pyramid building blocks, legos, robot builders, and more.
We interact with the kiddos during play times and engage them in thoughtful engineering play (assisting with building, asking questions about what they’re building or bringing them different materials)
We utilize active activities such as robot racers where one kid pretends to be a programmer and one pretends to be the program or “robot” and they use arrows and special tiles to create a program for the robot to follow without getting tripped up. If the program isn’t feasible, the programmer must use critical thinking to tweak their program and get the robot to the other side.'
      - subtitle: "Mathematics:"
        description: "Practicing drawing and recognizing numbers is part of our regular math curriculum. Shapes and pre-geometry skills are as well.
Using manipulative such as unifix cubes, counting bears and more are used to help them gain awareness of numbers and how they work together
We use counting songs and rhymes to help with rote counting skills and spend time looking for numbers in their environment throughout the day."
  - title: Social Emotional Development
    description: "Our staff is trained in social emotional development and Developmentally Appropriate Practices (DAP) with many of them having degrees in Early Childhood Education
We use books, pictures, figurines and one on one interactions to help the kids understand complex emotions and virtues
We are always working with our kids during their interactions with each other and adults to develop appropriate coping mechanisms and interactions. We stress Delopmentally Appropriate Practices (DAP) in all aspects of our program. For guidance in behavior, we use redirection and offer choices instead of harsh discipline and find that our students respond well to these methods."
