This class is offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9am-12pm during the school year. This class is for children who are 3 years old and are entering school for the first time. 

In this class we focus on solidifying letters, numbers, counting to 20 (or beyond when ready), colors, sorting, matching, shapes and art. This is also when we introduce students to the concepts of sitting still for group lessons, working as a team with other students, sharing toys, standing in line, and social skills. STEM concepts will be introduced in this class as well using games, science experiments and group activities that focus on introducing these four important fields of study.
