After school care: 

Kindergarten-5th graders can spend their time after school getting homework help, playing minecraft, doing engineering projects, science experiments, art, playing games, trivia, fooseball and more. 
After School: We pick your child up from school and they remain until 6pm at the latest. $395/month $100 yearly registration fee. Transportation to & from school included. This is a program for school-days and half-days only, we cannot keep kids all day on non-school days. Alternate care will be needed on those days. The are several drop in full day care facilities in the area. We will have some summer camp opportunities. We currently serve Tambark Creek Elementary, Woodside Elementary and Little Cedars Elementary.
