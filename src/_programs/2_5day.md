This class is designed for students who are 4 years old by August 31st of the year they will enter the class. 

In this class, we will focus on exposure to beginning literacy, math, social studies, science, history, art and classroom/social skills. Our teachers are experienced in preparing children for success in Kindergarten and beyond. STEM will be incorporated daily using both screen and non-screen activities, experiments, group games and toys designed with STEM in mind. Play and social growth is also an important aspect of our day.
