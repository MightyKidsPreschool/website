This class is designed for students who are 3 years old by September 1st of the year they will enter the class. 

In this class, we will focus on beginning reading, math, social studies, science, history, art and classroom/social skills. Our teachers are experienced in preparing children for success in Kindergarten and beyond. STEM will be incorporated daily using both screen and non-screen activities, experiments, group games and toys designed with STEM in mind. Play and social growth is also an important aspect of our day.
