Mighty kids will provide a comprehensive assessment and curate a full curriculum in each area of study that is unique to each child. We will provide tracking and monitoring of your childâ€™s progress and provide tailored instruction through videos, modules and Zoom calls with an Early Childhood Educator. We will walk you and your child through lessons in language & literacy, writing, fine motor, math, social and emotional development and independent functioning needed to begin Kindergarten with confidence.
