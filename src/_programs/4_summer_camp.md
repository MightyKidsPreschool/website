Description:
Learning is sweet with science that you can eat! Have some fun and play with your food while learning the science behind it. Learn how to give up the paintbrush in favor of apples, peppers and more to create beautiful works of art using only food! Edible Engineering combines physical science and food items to captivate even the most reluctant participant. From marshmallows to Pop Rocks, this is a tasty source for food experiments. The best part of the week is the ice cream truck will be making a visit. Chocolate, marshmallows, chewing gum, cotton candy… this week of candy chemistry will give you a serious sugar rush! (One treat given per day, will not be eating candy all day).
